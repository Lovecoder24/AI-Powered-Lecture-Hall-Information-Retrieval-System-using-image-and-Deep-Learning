Transition to Data Collection and ML Training Phase

Handoff Instructions:

Artifacts Provided: Architecture (architecture.json), wireframes (wireframes.json), MVP (mvp.dart).

Next Steps: Collect dataset (1000+ images/hall) for RecognitionModule training.

Requirements: Focus on must-have features (image capture, recognition).

Notes: Ensure dataset includes varied lighting/angles; validate against wireframe specs.


Integration Flow





CameraModule: Streamlit UI uploads image, sends to API via POST.



RecognitionModule: Django API processes image with TFLite, returns hall ID.



Flow: User uploads image -> Streamlit sends to /api/recognize/ -> Django returns hall_id -> Streamlit displays result.
